# city_explorer_api

**Author**: Michelle Salazar
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
This app allows you to search a city, and returns a location map, local eateries, movies names who have a link to the location and the weather.

## Getting Started
First I must make the wireframe, create the servers and link the API's. Next Ill need to write a code that will recognize the user's input data and return the results of the search.
